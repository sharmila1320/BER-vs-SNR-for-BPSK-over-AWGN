🔹 Project : BER vs SNR for BPSK over AWGN Channel                                                                                                                           

🎯 Objective:
Simulate how Bit Error Rate (BER) changes with SNR for BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying) in an AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) channel. This is foundational in wireless system design and essential for RIS-based systems too.

📐 Concepts:
BPSK Modulation: Maps 0 to -1 and 1 to +1

AWGN Noise: Gaussian noise added to the signal

Bit Detection: Based on received symbol's sign

📈 Output:
A log-scale plot showing:

Simulated BER curve (based on noisy received bits)

Theoretical BER curve (ideal BPSK in AWGN)

💡 Why This Matters:
BER vs SNR is a classic performance metric in wireless systems.

It's expected knowledge for anyone applying to comms research roles.

It also gives you room to later modify it for RIS-enhanced systems!
